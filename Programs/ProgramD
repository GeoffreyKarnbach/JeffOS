Program to compute fibonacci numbers, until n-th value (Retrieved from ROM position 0)
Requirement for ROM configuraiton:
 - Position 0 (Address 0x0): n, the value that the program should write
====
0 | READ A,0
1 | READ B,1
2 | READ C,1
3 | READ D,1
4 | MINUS A,D
5 | MINUS A,D
6 | STORE 0,C | Start of loop, store old value into position 0 of RAM to retrieve it after addition into Register B
7 | ADD C,B
8 | LOAD B,0 | Restore value from RAM to compute next fibonacci number
9 | MINUS A,D | Reduce by 1 the loop status
10 | JUMPZ 12 | Jump to last instruction if the loop has been run A-2 times
11 | JUMP 6 | Return to loop 
12 | WRITE 1023,C | Write result to ROM Position 1023
